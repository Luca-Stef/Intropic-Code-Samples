Code samples for Sam.

Finance is a basic flask web application that allows you to simulate buying, selling, and getting stock price quotes. You should be able to run it locally or if not just try it on the cs50 ide (https://ide.cs50.io/). From the finance directory by running export API_KEY="key" (with the key at the top of the application.py file) followed by flask run. Discplaimer: some of the code was written by the cs50x teaching staff, such as layout.html and helpers.c but I read over this code and fully understand it. I hope it works fine but I have never ran it on any PC but my own and I also just switched over from CS50's SQL implementation to the standard sqlite3 which produced a ton of bugs I had to fix.
